1.0.0 (2020-08-03)
==================

- Fix to run under Windows with Python 3.
  [nilshofer, jensens]

0.16 (2013-02-18)
=================

- Fix packaging error.
  [davisagli]

- Fix tests to work with buildout 2.
  [davisagli]

0.15 (2012-05-12)
=================

- Integration with Travis CI for running tests and pep8/pyflakes.
  [hvelarde]

- PEP 8/Pyflakes.
  [hvelarde]

- Optimized unlinking of junctioned dirs on Windows.
  [lck]

0.14 (2012-04-30)
=================

- Change the approach to building the omelette using NTFS junctions
  on Windows. This is now done via the ``ntfsutils`` package, rather
  than relying on junction.exe.
  [lck]

0.13 (2012-04-14)
=================

- Added forward-compatibility with Python 3.
  [mitchell]

0.12 (2011-09-08)
=================

- Replaced os.popen with subprocess equivalent
  [tom_gross]

- Quote path on windows to handle paths with spaces correctly
  [tom_gross]

0.11 (2011-07-18)
=================

- Sort top_level metadata to avoid error building omelette if they are out of
  order.  Fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/collective.buildout/+bug/553005.
  Thanks to Leonardo Rochael Almeida.
  [davisagli]

0.10 (2010-11-22)
=================

- Provide an update function (equivalent to install) to avoid spurious "recipe
  "doesn't define an update method" warning.
  [davisagli]

- Print a warning rather than aborting the buildout if junction.exe is missing
  on Windows.
  [davisagli]

- Made the tests compatible with a zc.buildout installed with Distribute
  rather than Setuptools.
  [pumazi]

- Handle OSErrors on symlink and warn the user. MacOSX can raise OSError due
  to an existing file here even if os.path.exists returns False.
  [MatthewWilkes]

- Include modules from namespace packages in the omelette. (Namespace packages
  cannot define anything in __init__.py, but they can contain modules.)
  [hathawsh]

- Made the tests compatible with virtualenv.
  [hathawsh]

0.9 (2009-04-11)
================

- Adjusted log-levels to be slightly less verbose for non-critical
  errors. [malthe]

0.8 (2009-01-14)
================

- Fixed 'OSError [Errno 20] Not a directory' on zipped eggs, for
  example when adding the z3c.sqlalchemy==1.3.5 egg.
  [maurits]

0.7 (2008-09-10)
================

- Actually add namespace declarations to generated __init__.py files.
  [davisagli]

- Use egg-info instead of guessing paths from package name. This also fixes
  eggs which have a name different from the contents.
  [fschulze]

0.6 (2008-08-11)
================

- Documentation changes only.
  [davisagli]

0.5 (2008-05-29)
================

- Added uninstall entry point so that the omelette can be uninstalled on
  Windows without clobbering things outside the omelette path.
  [optilude]

- Support Windows using NTFS junctions (see
  http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/FileAndDisk/Junction.mspx)
  [optilude]

- Ignore zipped eggs and fakezope2eggs-created links.
  [davisagli]

- Added 'packages' option to allow merging non-eggified Python packages to
  any directory in the omelette (so that, for instance, the contents of
  Zope's lib/python can be merged flexibly).
  [davisagli]

0.4 (2008-04-07)
================

- Added option to include Products directories.
  [davisagli]

- Fixed ignore-develop option.
  [davisagli]

0.3 (2008-03-30)
================

- Fixed test infrastructure.
  [davisagli]

- Added option to ignore develop eggs
  [claytron]

- Added option to ignore eggs
  [claytron]

- Added option to override the default omelette location.
  [davisagli]

0.2 (2008-03-16)
================

- Fixed so created directories are not normalized to lowercase.
  [davisagli]

0.1 (2008-03-10)
================

- Initial basic implementation.
  [davisagli]

- Created recipe with ZopeSkel.
  [davisagli]
